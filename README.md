# Chess 2
A variant of the game Chess with a randomization aspect, made in C++.

## Installation
To play the game, extract the Chess2-release zip-file and run the .exe file.

## Game Rules
The movement rules are the same as in the origianl Chess, but when a piece is clicked, it moves to a random legal square. The king must be captured to win the game, and the "check" mechanic does not exist in this game for this reason.

## WIP
To make the game more balanced, the rules will be changed so that pieces with too many possible moves will have a higher chance to capture a piece.
